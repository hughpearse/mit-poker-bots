class MyBot(Bot):
    """
     My custom Bot implementation that extendsa base Bot class. The logic
     and strategy of this bot is inspired by my own studies of partially observable
     games in A.I., as well as current academic literature on the subject of rational
     poker agents. Sources are noted where used. This class may be extended to
     be used as a basis for other poker bots. They must use strategy objects to
     create decisions however.
