# mit-poker-bots
This contains both a poker bot for player 1 and a command line interface to play against the bot for player 2. The MIT poker bots server is responsible for dealing the cards and evaluating the winner. The bot's strategy is to use the Bill Chen formula to calculate the strength of the hole cards, then upon the board cards being dealt, it uses an iterative Monte Carlo simulation to simulate 3000 matches per round. The hands in each iteration are evaluated using the Deuces hand evaluation library to compare the hand strength of the virtual players in the simulation. The win frequency is calculated as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The pot odds are then divided by the win frequency to infer the rate of return. If the rate of return is low, fold, medium then call or check, high then bet or raise.
